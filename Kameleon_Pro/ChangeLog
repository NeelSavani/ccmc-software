  kameleon-interpolator-1.0.0
  - Rewrote the Kameleon interpolator.  
  - Integrated the derived library into the Kameleon interpolator
  - Optimized the code - now 3-5 times faster

-------------
   derived-1.0.0
   - Modified the interfaces a little bit.  Added FileReader class.  Started process of
     extracting information out of CDF files to interpolate on more than one file at a time.
   - Added CDFlib(SELECT_,CDF_,current_cdf_id, NULL_); before all calls to kameleon. 
     Kameleon uses the internal CDF interface, and some functions assume a CDF file is selected. This
     ensures that the correct CDF file is selected.
   - added -arch x86_64 and -arch ppc64 to CPPFLAGS when using the --enable-universal option
