  kameleon-plus-0.1.11
  - Fixed ENLIL interpolation. Theta and Phi were switched.
  
2011 May 12   David Berrios
-------------
  kameleon-plus-0.1.10
  - Added MAS
  - Fixed logic when deleting latitudes in spherical tracer
  - Removed ENLIL's support for x,y,z coordinate names. This was too confusing!
  
2011 Jan 06   David Berrios
-------------
  kameleon-plus-0.1.6
  - Fixed interpolation for Adapt3d
    
2010 Nov 19   David Berrios
-------------
  kameleon-plus-0.1.5
  - Added extra error checking when opening files
  - Modified the ENLIL code to work with component names using the traditional spherical coordinate
    names (r,phi,theta) or the older cartesian names (x,y,z)

2010 Nov 04   David Berrios
-------------
  kameleon-plus-0.1.4
  - Added Adapt3D support
  - Added error checking for model file variables and attributes. Still not complete.

2010 Oct 29   David Berrios
-------------
  kameleon-plus-0.1.3
  - Updated version.  Not sure when these were added, but it now has a fieldline tracer, and initial support for enlil
  - Added the wrapper code for multiple languages

2009 Sep 10   David Berrios
-------------
  kameleon-interpolator-0.1.0
  - renamed the distribution to 0.1.0, since the interpolator isn't complete yet
  - modified OpenGGCMInterpolator to handle cases that caused crashes (array index out of bounds)

2009 Jul 17   David Berrios
-------------
  kameleon-interpolator-1.0.0
  - Rewrote the Kameleon interpolator.  
  - Integrated the derived library into the Kameleon interpolator
  - Optimized the code - now 3-5 times faster
  
2009 Jun 02   David Berrios
-------------
   derived-1.0.0
   - Modified the interfaces a little bit.  Added FileReader class.  Started process of
     extracting information out of CDF files to interpolate on more than one file at a time.
   - Added CDFlib(SELECT_,CDF_,current_cdf_id, NULL_); before all calls to kameleon. 
     Kameleon uses the internal CDF interface, and some functions assume a CDF file is selected. This
     ensures that the correct CDF file is selected.
   - added -arch x86_64 and -arch ppc64 to CPPFLAGS when using the --enable-universal option

2008 Sep 02   David Berrios
-------------
   derived-0.7.3
   - Added a radius of 0 to the start of the calculated magnetopause
   
2008 Aug 19   David Berrios
-------------
   derived-0.7.2
   - Added methods to calculate the magnetopause using the Shue model
   
2008 Aug 15   David Berrios
-------------
   derived-0.7.1
   - Added the Shue model
   
2008 Aug 07   David Berrios
-------------
   derived-0.7.0
   - Fixed compute_exbz to interpolate correct variables

2008 Aug 06   David Berrios
-------------
   derived-0.6.9
   - Added b1 and components to the listOfRequiredVariablesForVectors map.  This fixed the slow tracing performance of b1

2008 Jul 29   David Berrios
-------------
   derived-0.6.8
   - Added a check for "open_ggcm" in Derived::interpolateSimple .  The previous behavior was undefined.
   - Added eta*j and eta*j2
   
2008 Jul 18   David Berrios
-------------
   derived-0.6.7
   - Modified calculation methods to return missing if any of the required variables are missing.
   - Converted input string to interpolator to lower case.  

2008 May 12   David Berrios
-------------
   derived-0.6.6
   - Reorganized derived.cpp into separate files, one for each computation method
   - Added more documentation
